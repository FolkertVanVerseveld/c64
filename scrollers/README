Simple scroller demos

Note that some scrollers play background music and that these paths are
hardcoded as absolute paths. You have to download the High Voltage Sid
Collection (see hvsc.c64.org) and specify the absolute path to the SIDs.

The programs are tested with HVSC #66, but should work for other versions as
well.
